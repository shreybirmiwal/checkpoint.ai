Question: What is the pH of a .15 sr(OH)2 solution?
Correct steps:
1) Sr(OH)2 is a strong base
2) Create a rice table. Sr(OH)2 is a 1:2 ratio to create OH-. (.30M OH- is created)
3) pOH = -log(.3) = .522
3) pH = 14-pOH = 13.477
Correct answer: pH = 13.477

Student steps:
1) .15M Sr(OH-)2 has .15 moles of OH-
2) pH = -log(.15) = .8239
Student answer: pH = .8239
